# SCSS STYLES KIT

This is WIP and will change. Might even move away from .scss to a postcss / jsxstyle world, cause as @necolas [supposedly said](https://medium.com/bumpers/isnt-our-code-just-the-best-f028a78f33a9) "React had essentially solved all the problems in the Front End Development space", and cause nextjs is pretty cool.

Needs a build tool. Use [this](https://github.com/callumflack/gulp-boilerplate) if stuck.

An `.editorconfig` is included. Use it to avoid dumb-ass whitespace commits, etc.

A `.gitignore` is also included.

Primary (current) influences:
* [SuitCSS](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/README.md)
* [@csswizardry 's "Hungarian notation"](https://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/)

Future influences?
* [NextJS](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)
* [Rebass?](https://github.com/jxnblk/rebass)

# TODO
- [ ] use npm to bring in SuitCSS and bundle it into separate file
- [ ] make use of CSS variables within SCSS, e.g.: 
    - https://css-tricks.com/css-custom-properties-theming/
    - https://css-tricks.com/now-css-custom-properties-thing-value-parts-can-changed-individually/
- [ ] keep up with new Suits:
