# SCSS STYLES KIT

This is WIP and will change. Might even move away from .scss to a postcss / jsxstyle world, cause as @necolas [supposedly said](https://medium.com/bumpers/isnt-our-code-just-the-best-f028a78f33a9) "React had essentially solved all the problems in the Front End Development space"

Primary influences:
* [SuitCSS](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/README.md)
* [@csswizardry 's "Hungarian notation"](https://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/)

Needs a build tool, but none attached here. Use [this](https://github.com/callumflack/gulp-boilerplate) if stuck.

An `.editorconfig` is included. Use it to avoid dumb-ass whitespace commits, etc.

A `.gitignore` is also included.
